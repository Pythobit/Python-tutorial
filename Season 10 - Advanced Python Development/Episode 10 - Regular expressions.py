# Regular Expressions in python

"""
"Getting" regex is a matter of seeing patterns
and being able to express them using languages

Four most important components:
[.] period : "anything" - letters, numbers, symbols,.. but no newlines
[+] plus : "one or more of"
[*] asterisk : "zero or more of"
[?] question mark : "zero or one of"

example - jose@teclado.com
            .*
            .+
