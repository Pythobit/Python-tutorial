 Your Task,
 is to create a movie storage application, that will allow users to manage their movie collection and find any movie they want.
 Here's, three main features.,
 - first, the application must allow users to add new movie to their collections.
 - The application must allow users to view all the movies in their collection.
 - The application must also allow users to find any particular movie by any of its attribute.,
 
 What are movies.?
 Movies will be dictionaries, but you can define the structure of the dictionary to be anything you like., for example., you may choose to have movies as dictionaries 
 with only three keys:
 {
    'name': 'The Matrix',
    'director': 'Wachowskis'
    'year': '1994'
 }
 
 or you may choose to have more keys like location, shelf., etc.
 
 Where will movies be stored.?
 it's up to you where movies will be stored, as long as you can then print them, retrieve them, and find them. A good potential structure coukd be a list. if you are familiar
 with files and storing things in file, go for that.!
 
 What's that about finding movies.?
 Once you have the movie structure defined, users should be able to e.g: "find all movies released in 1994." or "find all movies by director Rolf Smith."
 
 That means the user must be able to tell you what property they are looking for (is it year, director, or something else); and also they must be able too tell you what 
 they're looking for (1994, or Rolf Smith in the examples above).
 
 With both the property and the value, you'll ab;e to find all movies which match both. it's tricky! Spend some time, and i'm sure you'll get it.
