I'm really excited for this challenge, and you should be too!

This is a common challenge that you could be asked to complete when you apply for graduate and entry-level programming jobs. 
It's not an impossible challenge—I'm sure you'll be able to do it—but it requires some careful thinking and following the instructions provided to the letter.

The FizzBuzz challenge
In this exercise, print out 100 numbers, from 1 to 100 (both inclusive). But:
1. Instead of printing multiples of 3, print "Fizz".
2. Instead of printing multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
3. Instead of printing multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

That means your program will print a combination of numbers, Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.
For example:
- 1
- 2
- Fizz , Since 3 is a multiple of 3
- 4
- Buzz , Since 5 is a multiple of 5
- Fizz
- 7
- 8
- Fizz
- Buzz
- 11
- Fizz
- 13
- 14
- FizzBuzz , Since 15 is multiple of both 3 and 5
- 16
- 17
- Fizz
- 19
- Buzz
-- Continue upto and (including 100)
Make Sure your program prints from 1 to 100 both inclusive.
