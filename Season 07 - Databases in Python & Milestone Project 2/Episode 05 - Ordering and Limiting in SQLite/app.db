# Ordering and Limiting in SQLite

# Ordering
SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY amount
# This will give table in ascending order of amount.

# Limiting
SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1
# LIMIT 1 will give only one row, i.e: Walmart finding out the customer who spends a lot of money for a Withdraw or something else.
# DESC - Descending
# This will give table in descending order of amount.
# default is ASC - ascending
