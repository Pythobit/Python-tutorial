age=30     #Variable
print(age) #Output - 30

print(30)  #we can simply print a number by writing it inside print statement #Output - 30

age=20
print(age)  #Output - 20
age=30      #changing the value of the variable will not update previous variable value
print(age)  #Output - 30

F_age=30    # Variables cannot start with a number
# Underscore to differentiate b/w variables, so we can add numbers too, nothing else.

# Using underscores between words gives snake_case
# Using capital letters between words gives Camelcase
# Constant variables to be written in Block e.g: PI=3.14159
