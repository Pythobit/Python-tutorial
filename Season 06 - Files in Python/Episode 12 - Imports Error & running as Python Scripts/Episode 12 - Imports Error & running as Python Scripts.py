# Imports Error & running as Python Scripts.

"""
IMPORT ERROR

if your module is already imported, you can import it the same way, but if you want to access something inside in it,
python will look into the module & give you an error because it's going to be back n forth,
called `circular import` [bad thing]

"""
"""
RUNNING AS PYTHON SCRIPTS

if you want to run a specific code when you run a specific file, do this

if __name__ =  '__main__':
    print(find_in(['Rolf', 'Jose', 'Jen'], lambda x: x, 'Jose'))
