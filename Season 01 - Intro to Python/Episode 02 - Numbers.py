# 2. Numbers

age = 35  # Integer
PI = 3.14159  # Float & Constant(Variables to be represented in Block letters)

# Now we'll divide numbers to check for optimal solution
F_divison = 12/4
print(F_divison)  # Output - 3.0 = one division operator will give a float.
F_divison = 12//4
print(F_divison)  # Output - 3 = two division operator will give an integer.

# Remainder of a division
x = 37
rem = x % 2
print(rem)  # Output - 1
# e.g: A table with gray row after every one line
#     if odd, set background = grey
#     if even, set background = white
